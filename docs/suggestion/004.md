# UnnamedDiscriminatedUnionFieldAnalyzer

## Problem

In [dotnet/fsharp#15665](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/issues/15665) it is recommended that all union case fields have a name.  
With the exception that for a single field union case.

```fsharp
type DU =
    // Triggers analyzer 
    | Example of int * name: string
```

## Fix

Add the missing name:

```fsharp
type DU =
    | Example of age: int * name: string
```
